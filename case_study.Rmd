### Brainstorm questions

*Where are max and min air bnb prices?
  *what are average prices?
*Where are prices going up and down over time?
*What's the relationship between number of reviews and average review?
*Does room type affect availability?
*What's the location of the unit? 
  *What area are popular?
  *Popularity = number of units? Average price?
*Are there repeat hosts?
  *If so, what does that mean?
